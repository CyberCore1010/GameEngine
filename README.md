# GameEngine

Alpha 0.1 is simply the barebones of the engine. It includes so far methods to start the Game including making the window, making the game Componant for the window, a Camera, and a main method to start it. It also includes the default objects that every game will require such as EventHandler, KeyHandler, ObjectHandler and stateHandler. Finally I've started work on the optional objects starting with the object Player which impliments interfaces Movable, Name, and Positionable.

The engine is clearly in an early state and will be expanded as time goes on
